Build Apps useful for improving the Quality of Life of Senior Citizens
Initially, I plan to document good resources and topics. I will then use them to identify needs and build apps. 

Livability: TIME magazine of February 26, 2018 was focused on Longevity. The [Miliken Institute](http://successfulaging.milkeninstitute.org/) ranks metropolitan areas based on livability of elder citizens. My almamater city, Madison, WI, comes in second. 

Taxes: [Kiplinger's Retirement Report](https://www.kiplinger.com/) of February 2018 (need to subscribe) provides an actionable idea based on the new federal tax code: Convert funds in a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA to take advantage of the lower, albeit temporary, income tax 2017-2025. Tax rates may increase later. Funds in the Roth IRA will grow tax deferred and will be tax free for later withdrawal. it is also tax free to pass it on to children.<br><br>  
Another page at Kiplinger's website is on [taxes](https://www.kiplinger.com/tool/retirement/T055-S001-state-by-state-guide-to-taxes-on-retirees/index.php?rid=PROD-LINKS) for retirees. FL is ranked as one of the most tax friendly states for retirees, while the opposite is true for Maryland and Wisconsin.  

Retiree Withdrawal Rate: AAII has an [article](http://www.aaii.com/)(may have to subscribe) on the safe withdrawal rate for retirees:"Insights on Using the 4% Withdrawal Rule from Its Creator." The article uses Yale Professor Robert Shiller's CAPE (cyclically adjusted price-earnings) ratio to recommend a safe withdrawal rate. Based on the work of Michael Kitces, lower withdrawals are warranted during periods of high valuations (as the current period of 2010 on, with the CAPE index above 20), while higher withdrawal rates can be sustained during periods of low valuation. 

Investment strategy for retirees. AAII has a [recent article](http://www.aaii.com/journal/article3/reduce-stock-exposure-in-retirement-or-gradually-increase-it?viewall=true) on this. They recommend, in a contrarian mode, increasing equity exposure throughout retirement can actually enhance retirement outcomes. The original scientific article is available [here](https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/Reducing%20Retirement%20Risk%20with%20a%20Rising%20Equity%20Glide%20Path.aspx). "Depending on the underlying assumptions, the optimal starting equity exposures are generally around 20 percent to 40 percent and finish at around 40 percent to 80 percent." ..."These generally perform better than static rebalanced portfolios or declining equity glide paths."
